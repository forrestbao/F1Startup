# Stock

Shares or ownership in a C corp are called **stock**. You can read [this article from Investopedia about stocks for any C corp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorizedstock.asp). 

# Can I deal with stock later? 
No. 

Many sources ([Clerky](https://help.clerky.com/article/2659-stock-plan-adoption-timing)) suggest a startup to adopt a stock plan, i.e., the allocation of shares among parties, at formation. Hence, founders should learn it at the beginning. 


# Authorized vs. issued stock 
The process of giving stock to parties, including founders, is called **issurance** (not iNsurrance). 
Before stocks can be issued, they need to be **authorized**. 
To know the difference between them, you can read [this article on Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorizedstock.asp), which is for any corporation not only startups.

# How many shares and how to split them? 

The common rule is, at formation of a startup, to authorize 

> 10M shares, 80% of which are split between founders and 20% of which for  key future employees (a.k.a. option pools).

I found [this article from Clerky](https://help.clerky.com/article/1717-initial-share-allocation) and [this article from Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/docs/atlas/issuing-stock) very helpful.
Per the Clerky article, a small amount of unissued stock can be used to give to accelerator programs. 
But, many sources do not recommend a large amount of unissued (but authorized) stock for startups for [tax reasons](https://help.clerky.com/article/1726-how-does-delaware-calculate-the-franchise-tax-and-what-is-the-minimum-tax-for-a-startup).

You might wonder why 10M shares instead of 100 to be easy. I had the same question. Then I googled and there are many reasons and conventions behind it. So just stick to it. 

# Stock vesting

If a founder departs, then his/her shares become a thorny topic. That's why a stock vesting schedule is important. [This article from Clerky](https://help.clerky.com/article/1753-why-do-startup-founders-subject-their-shares-to-vesting) explains it very well. 
A common rule is 
> vesting in 4 years, linearly (1/48th per month), with a 1-year cliff (getting nothing if service is less than a year).
